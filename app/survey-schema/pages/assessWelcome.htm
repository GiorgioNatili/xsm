The rest of the questionnaire is self-administered. These questions are for research purposes only. All personal information is kept private and confidential, your clinician will NOT see your answers, and no information will be stored in your medical record. However, if there is an immediate concern about your safety or the safety of others, the study coordinator will need to inform your doctor.

You do not have to answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable or upset. Your involvement with this study will not affect your medical care, and you may stop participation at any time.

If you have any questions throughout this questionnaire, please bring your tablet to the Study coordinator.
